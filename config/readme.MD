# Configuration
You have to go and create two Nat networks in Virtualbox:
- One Internet that has 192.168.1.0/24
- One Private that has 10.10.1.0/24
Then we assign to all 3 machines the NAT adapter in the first interface and then:
- In Attacker we add a second interface with the Internet NAT
- In Alice we add a second interface with the Internet NAT and a third interface with the Private NAT
- In Bob we add a second interface with the Private NAT.
