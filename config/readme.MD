# Configuration
Remember to do:

```
chmod +x ./
```

To give execution permissions.
## Network
You have to go and create two Nat networks in Virtualbox:

- One Internet that has 192.168.1.0/24
- One Private that has 10.10.1.0/24

Then we assign to all 3 machines the NAT adapter in the first interface and then:

- In Attacker we add a second interface with the Internet NAT
- In Alice we add a second interface with the Internet NAT and a third interface with the Private NAT
- In Bob we add a second interface with the Private NAT.

Now you can use the check script to check the connections.

## Kernel
We are going to install the [mainline](https://github.com/bkw777/mainline) to install the 5.4 kernel, just for having an unified kernel to work in the project.

Once installed we check the version by doing:

```
ls /lib/modules
```

We copy the version in the first line of the kernel file, and execute the file (if it does not work follow [this](https://gist.github.com/chaiyujin/c08e59752c3e238ff3b1a5098322b363). When it is done we perform:

```
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```
